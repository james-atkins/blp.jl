# blp.jl - BLP demand estimation with Julia

blp.jl is a Julia implementation of the routines for estimating the demand for differentiated products with BLP-type random coefficients logit models. Particular focus is given to performance. This is primarily a project so I can learn Julia.

This project is very much work in progress. The end goal is more a toolkit of useful functions, as compared to more comprehensive but less flexible packages like the (excellent) [pyblp](https://github.com/jeffgortmaker/pyblp).
